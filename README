NAME
    Cave::Wrapper - A Wrapper to the Paludis 'cave' Client.

VERSION
    version 0.01000004

DESCRIPTION
    "cave" is a package management client for the Paludis
    <http://paludis.pioto.org/> package manager available for use with both
    the Exherbo Linux <http://exherbo.org/> and Gentoo Linux
    <http://gentoo.org/> Distributions.

    This module is designed as a syntactic sugar wrapper for that client to
    minimize development time and clarify code.

        my $cave = Cave::Wrapper->new();
        my @ids = $cave->print_ids(qw( --matches  dev-lang/perl ));

METHODS
    Methods are generated entirely at run-time by introspecting the output
    from "cave print-commands --all" and then generating the appropriate
    methods. This is mostly because we don't want to have to cut a new
    release every time paludis produce a new release *just* to avoid
    breaking code.

CAVEATS
  Naming Collisions
    There exists 1 command we cannot perform a native mapping for, and its
    due to a perlism, and that is "import".

    For now, this is named "cave_import" instead,

  Hyphenated Commands
    Hyphenated commands can't be used as method names in Perl, so we've
    translated the hyphens to underscores in the method names.

    i.e.: if you wanted "print-ids" you now want "print_ids"

  Slightly Underpowered
    This is a first-pass "Just get it working" implementation at this time,
    and is reasonably useful for the print_ family of commands the cave
    client provides. However, you probably do not wish to use it for more
    complex things like calling "cave resolve" as it might cause you untold
    sorrows while it silently buffers into a growing array and then spews
    its contents when its finished.

TODO
    One day we'd like to have a sweeter syntax, like

        $cave->print_ids({ matches => 'dev-lang/perl' })

    or

        $cave->print_ids({ matches => [ 'dev-lang/perl' , 'dev-lang/python' ]});

    However, there are a few problems and questions to be answered, which
    are not a problem with the existing syntax but would be a problem with a
    possible alternative syntax.

    *   Toggle Switches

        There are a lot of toggle switches that don't take a parameter, and
        while we could just do

            $cave->print_commands({ all => 1 });

        That means we have to get rid of the '1' before we pass the command
        to "cave", and that is going to be difficult to do without needing
        tight coupling. Not to mention how to handle "all => 2" and "all =>
        1".

    *   Fixed Order operations.

        Some "cave" functions require operators to be ordered, so if you
        needed to do this

            cave foobar --matching foo --not --matching bar

        having a structure

            $cave->foobar({ matching => [ 'foo', 'bar' ]} , '--not' )

        would obviously not work.

            $cave->foobar([ matching => 'foo', not => matching => 'bar' ])

        or anything not using a hash is going to be equally confusing,
        especially as we can now no longer tell what is a key and what is a
        value, so adding '--' to the front of them becomes impossible.
